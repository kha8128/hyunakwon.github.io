### Materials Characterization

#### Current Challenges:
Amorphous carbon (a-C) is a widely used material in electronics, energy storage, and coatings due to its unique properties, including high hardness, chemical stability, and tunable electronic properties. However, predicting its structure-property relationships remains a challenge due to its disordered nature. Characterizing amorphous carbon accurately is crucial to understand its performance in various applications, yet conventional methods struggle with its complex, non-crystalline structure.

#### Our Approach:
To address these challenges, I have applied machine learning models to predict the three-dimensional structure of amorphous carbon based on spectroscopy data. Using neural networks, we link spectral features to the atomic structure, allowing us to uncover previously unknown structure-spectrum relationships. This work also lays the foundation for using <b>generative models</b> to design new amorphous materials with desired properties.

### Environmental Remediation 

#### Current Challenges:
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that are highly persistent in the environment and human body, leading to adverse health effects. Major challenges include:
- **Persistence**: PFAS are often called "forever chemicals" because they don't break down easily in the environment.
- **Toxicity**: Emerging research links PFAS to several serious health conditions such as cancer, hormone disruption, and immune system dysfunction.
- **Remediation**: Current methods to remove or degrade PFAS from water and soil are expensive and not entirely efficient.

To address these challenges, I have applie machine learning approaches to uncover structure-property relationship to predict bioactivities and degradability of PFAS.
