### Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 

#### Current Challenges:
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that are highly persistent in the environment and human body, leading to adverse health effects. Major challenges include:
- **Persistence**: PFAS are often called "forever chemicals" because they don't break down easily in the environment.
- **Toxicity**: Emerging research links PFAS to several serious health conditions such as cancer, hormone disruption, and immune system dysfunction.
- **Remediation**: Current methods to remove or degrade PFAS from water and soil are expensive and not entirely efficient.

To address these challenges, researchers are exploring various strategies, including novel materials for PFAS adsorption, advanced catalytic degradation, and predictive models for understanding PFAS behavior.
