### Materials Characterization

#### Current Challenges:
Amorphous carbon (a-C) is a widely used material in electronics, energy storage, and coatings due to its unique properties, including high hardness, chemical stability, and tunable electronic properties. Characterizing amorphous carbon accurately is crucial to understand its performance in various applications, yet conventional methods struggle with its complex, non-crystalline structure.

#### Our Approach:
To address these challenges, I have applied <b>machine learning</b> models to predict the three-dimensional structure of amorphous carbon based on spectroscopy data. Using neural networks, we link spectral features to the atomic structure, allowing us to uncover previously unknown structure-spectrum relationships. This work also lays the foundation for using <b>generative models</b> to design new materials with desired properties.

### Porous and Nanostructured Materials

#### Current Challenges:
Porous and nanostructured materials exhibit unique properties that make them essential for a wide range of applications, from energy storage to catalysis. However, understanding how molecular-level phenomena, such as proton transfer and gas adsorption, behave within these structures is still a significant challenge.

#### Proton Transfer in Nanoporous TiO₂ (Machine Learning Potential)
Nanoporous TiO₂ exhibits unique water splitting catalytic properties, critical for applications such as photocatalysis and energy storage. By leveraging <b>machine learning potentials</b>, we explore the confinement effects on proton transfer within these materials. This allows us to better understand and predict proton behavior within the nanoporous environment, optimizing porous coatings for improved performance.

#### Hydrogen Storage in Metal-Organic Frameworks (DFT Thermodynamics)
Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous materials known for their capacity to store gases like hydrogen. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we study the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen adsorption in MOFs, providing insights into their potential use in hydrogen storage applications. This research aims to design MOF structures with improved hydrogen storage capacity and stability, contributing to energy storage solutions.

### Environmental Remediation 

#### Current Challenges:
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that are highly persistent in the environment and human body, leading to adverse health effects. Major challenges include:
- **Persistence**: PFAS are often called "forever chemicals" because they don't break down easily in the environment.
- **Toxicity**: Emerging research links PFAS to several serious health conditions such as cancer, hormone disruption, and immune system dysfunction.
- **Remediation**: Current methods to remove or degrade PFAS from water and soil are expensive and not entirely efficient.

To address these challenges, I have applie <b>machine learning</b> approaches to uncover structure-property relationship to predict bioactivities and degradability of PFAS.
