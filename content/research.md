### Environmental Remediation 

#### Current Challenges:
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that are highly persistent in the environment and human body, leading to adverse health effects. Major challenges include:
- **Persistence**: PFAS are often called "forever chemicals" because they don't break down easily in the environment.
- **Toxicity**: Emerging research links PFAS to several serious health conditions such as cancer, hormone disruption, and immune system dysfunction.
- **Remediation**: Current methods to remove or degrade PFAS from water and soil are expensive and not entirely efficient.

To address these challenges, I have applie machine learning approaches to uncover structure-property relationship to predict bioactivities and degradability of PFAS.
